# SimpleBottomNavigationSample
This is a working Andriod app using the Material Design library to implement a bottom bar navigation with Fragments and a ViewModel

BottomNav.java and activity_bottom_nav.xml outline the main bottom navigation bar used in the app
FragSampleFragment1.java and activity_frag_sample_fragment.xml (as well as FragSampleFragment2.java) are sample fragments that are loaded into a FrameLayout in BottomNav.java

This application is intended to give a beginning Andriod programmer an idea of how they might build a multi-activity app using Fragments
